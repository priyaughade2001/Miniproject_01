# Introduction
This is a basic calendar program created using simple c program, using this program you can navigate year or month using the arrow key of your keyboard.This mini project on Calendar in C programming language is a console application without graphics. To make the calendar look colorful, many windows properties have been used in this project. Besides the color used in backgrounds, the days of the month are white and the month(all months ) are indicated using the red foreground color. In this mini project, you can find out the day corresponding to a given date and view the days and dates corresponding to a particular month+year. 
  
# Features
- Track month and Year any
- The schedule view
- Easy to search days year and month

# Detail Requirements
## High Level Requirements: 
| ID | Description | Category | Status | 
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ---------|
| HR01 | User shall be able to specify the size of the matrix |Technical| IMPLEMENTED |
| HR02 | User shall be able to add the matrices| Techincal | IMPLEMENTED | 
| HR03 | User shall be able to subtract the matrices| Techincal |  IMPLEMENTED  |
| HR04 | User shall be able to multiply the matrices | Techincal |  IMPLEMENTED  |
| HR05 | User shall be able to find determinant, transpose and inverse of a matrix | Techincal |  IMPLEMENTED  |
##  Low level Requirements:
 
| ID | Description | HLR ID | Status (Implemented/Future) |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| LR01 | (1). User must specify the size of the matrix.                                                    (2). The size specified is the dimensions of the square matrix | HR01 |  IMPLEMENTED  |
| LR02 | Addition of two matrices can be done (1). Both the matrices need to be of same size(2). The size entered in the begining is same for both the matrices | HR02 |  IMPLEMENTED |
| LR03 | Subtraction of two matrices is implemented in the same manner as addition| HR03 | IMPLEMENTED |
| LR04 | Multiplication of two matrices is done on two square matrices of a specified size| HR04 |  IMPLEMENTED  |
| LR05 | The determinant of a single matrix of a specified size is implemented| HR05 |  IMPLEMENTED  |
| LR06 | The transpose of a single matrix operation is implemented | HR05 |  IMPLEMENTED  |
| LR07 | To find the inverse of a matrix, both the determinant function and the transpose functions are used in it. The condition that a matrix is invertible is to check if the determinant of the matrix is equal to 0. | HR05 |  IMPLEMENTED  |
